# variation-of-Linkedin-Likes-of-a-company-with-days-of-the-week
Explores what the number of a company's LinkedIn page "likes" statistics tells  us about traffic dependence on days of the week. Here, a meaningful relationship is derived. This relationship can be used by a company to better attract customers/clients via day-of-the-week specific advertisements.

In this project, only the first 10 giggest company in Fortune 500, in addition to Google and Facebook, were analyzed. All follow the model of quadratic dependence on number of likes in day of the week.
